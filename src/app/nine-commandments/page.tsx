        <h1>The Nine Commandments</h1>

        <p>
            In <a href="../comet-of-change#years">BC</a> a pair of mortals came
            to <a href="../divine-mirror">The Divine Mirror</a> seeking to settle a dispute.
            The Gods were offended by such casual contact from mortals, that they handed down The Nine Commandments in retribution.
