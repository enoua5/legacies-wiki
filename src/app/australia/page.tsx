        <h1>Australia</h1>

        <p>
            Australia is a firey locale in the far South-Eastern corner of the world.
            It is where the souls of the dead are sent if they do not follow the <a href="../nine-commandments">Commandments</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
            The Gods created Australia as a secure prison for the souls of sinners.
            The souls are directly guarded by <a href="../vegemite">Vegemite</a>, keeping constant watch for attempts to escape.
            Australia is entirely surrounded by <a href="../the-wall">The Wall</a> and the <a href="../grande-chasm">Grandé Chasm</a>.
            In the Grandé Chasm are <a href="../primordial-spider">Primordial Spiders</a>, and beyond it <a href="../electric-fence">The Electric Fence</a>.
            Additionally, the <a href="../nine-commandments#sixth">Sixth Commandment</a> forbids mortals from helping Australians.
        </p>
